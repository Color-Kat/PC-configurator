# PC-configurator

This is a simple tool for creating PC builds.
You can simply paste links to your PC parts into this configurator, 
add some names, prices and quantities and PC-configurator automatically
generate a special short link containing data about entire configuration of your PC.
Then you can share your link with other people.

The whole system works only on the client side without any server side. All PC config data are saved directly to URL in get parameters.
For short URL, I use yandex clck.ru service.

This project is made for RX4D.
